summary=If my wordpress cache plugin is going to serve static html pages to users to improve performance then, do I really need wordpress, php, mysql setup? Can I not just generate a static website and serve that? That is why I moved to baking my blog a with JBake.

I started my blogging with a free blog on wordpress.com. Few month's before, I moved from wordpress.com to self hosted wordpress.org blog. As I wanted more control on my hosting and blog, I opted for self managed VPS on [DigitalOcean.com](https://m.do.co/c/fff9bf2cbe08) (referral link) where I now host few blogs and sites using wordpress. 

Wordpress is really a good blogging/CMS platform, primarily developed in PHP. For me, I am working in Java related technologies for 9+ years now and the only time when I touched PHP was in first six months of my 9+ years technology career. Even though my blogs were not too much design intensive, I was always looking for functional enhancements. So my first problem, not knowing PHP. I know, everyone says Wordpress is  so easy that even a non-technical person can handle it. But I think, for a technical person with no-php background, it can be difficult. There were so many instances where I said to myself "Oh! I could have done it so quickly in Java". 

Wordpress without properly configured caching could be very slow and thus I used Caching plugin on my blogs which was converting all blog posts to static html and serve those to visitors for performance improvements. Also, it needed other resources like PHP, MySQL etc. which are too resource intensive. Then came a moment, I asked myself, Do I really need wordpress for my simple blogs and if ultimately I am serving static pages then why can't there be an alternate solution?

### Quest for 'that' solution

In last few weeks, I searched for alternatives and learned an interesting term "Static Site Generators".  In nutshell, Static Site Generators are frameworks that have predefined content structure that they can consume and generate a static html-only website from it. As these are pure HTML (with some javascript) pages, they don't need any language runtime (except a webserver). And what can be faster than serving a static html page (remember, in wordpress I was doing same with the help of caching plugins).

I think the most commonly used SSG may be [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from Github. It is written in Ruby and require Ruby and related components to create and maintain site. Ruby! Once again, something that I am not good at. Search continued and I found [JBake](http://jbake.org/). Finally! SSG written purely in Java, something that I am very good in. [This post](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/10/static-site-generator-shootout-jbake-vs-jekyll.html) by [Peter Backx](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/author/Peter-Backx/) lists out comparison between Jekyll and JBake.

### What is JBake?

[JBake](http://jbake.org/) is a static site/blog generator written purely in java and 100% an open source. You can find a source code on [Github](https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake/) and documentation on [JBake site](http://jbake.org/). In summary,

- You can write blog templates in any of your favorite templating engines like freemarker, groovy, thymeleaf etc and JBake supports it.  
- Default site generated by JBake has all required templates and can easily be customized.
- You can write your content in any format such as Markdown, HTML, ASCIIDOC. JBake will convert your content to static html pages.
- The best part is, It's written in Java and it is Open Source! Go ahead, Implement any awesome features you want.

### Where Am I Now?

After playing with JBake, I quickly built up my first blog (yes, the one you are looking at now). Here is what I have on this blog -

- Groovy Template created by me - [Github Source](https://github.com/manikmagar/clean-text-jbake-template)
  - Supports Google Analytics
  - Supports Disqus for comments
  - Support to use Github for commenting (I am using it on this blog)
- Github Managed blog content - [Github Source](https://github.com/manikmagar/mm-blog-data). Mostly I use [prose.io](https://prose.io) markup editor (integrated with Github) for writing content while I am online or [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) for local writing on Mac.
- Building of website on Ubuntu VPS with JBake
- Continuous auto-deployment from Github to Ubuntu VPS

### What Next?

Next will be few posts, that will elaborate on each part of my JBake setup. Stay tuned and keep watching this space!
